<h1>YOUR NAME</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  <p> at the moment we are considfering using one folder and sequentially access the correct lines rhather than having many pages.
    the plan is to implement Vercel  (18-12-2025 made account) to be able to update a field in one checkbox from one user </p>
    <p> and have the updated innfo available for another user.
    
      you can't implement full Vercel serverless API functionality directly inside a static HTML file.
      Vercel requires separate API route files (/api/update.js) in your GitHub repo that HTML calls via fetch().
      we need to create this API. 

  later note: it seems that: You can include everything directly in your static HTML file! No separate API route file needed.
Why This Works
Supabase is already your API/backend. When you use the Supabase JavaScript client in your HTML:

It talks directly to Supabase's servers
No need for your own backend/API files
Everything happens client-side (in the browser)
      You could even just use plain HTML + JavaScript hosted on GitHub Pages with Supabase handling all the backend. No Vercel needed at all!
The key insight: Supabase is your backend service (database + real-time). You can host your frontend files anywhere that serves HTML/JS.
