Required Materials

Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5

P93XR‑25 CS RD1 carrier board

M2.5 mounting screws (x4)

Pre‑terminated wire harness (red, black, yellow, green wires)

UV glue or hot‑melt adhesive (clear)

Required Tools

ESD wrist strap and ESD‑safe work surface

Phillips screwdriver (M2.5 compatible)

Tweezers

UV lamp (if UV glue is used)

Safety & ESD Precautions

Always wear an ESD wrist strap.

Handle boards by the edges only.

Do not touch connector contacts or IC pins.

Assembly Procedure
1. Preparation

Verify all parts match the bill of materials.

Inspect both boards for visible damage or contamination.

Place the carrier board on an ESD‑safe surface with the connectors facing upward.

2. Install Compute Module

Orient the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 so the dual board‑to‑board connectors align with the mating connectors on the carrier board.

Starting from one side, carefully press the compute module straight down into the connectors.

Apply even pressure until both connectors are fully seated. No visible gap should remain between the connectors.

3. Secure Compute Module

Align the four mounting holes of the compute module with the standoffs on the carrier board.

Install four M2.5 screws.

Tighten screws evenly in a cross pattern. Do not overtighten.

4. Wire Harness Installation

Route the wire harness along the PCB traces as shown in the reference images.

Solder or connect wires to the designated pads:

Red: Power

Black: Ground

Yellow / Green: Signal lines

Ensure wires are flat against the board and do not cross connector openings.

5. Wire Securing

Apply a small amount of clear adhesive over the wire anchor points.

Ensure adhesive covers the wire insulation and contacts the PCB for strain relief.

Cure adhesive per manufacturer instructions (UV or cooling time).

6. Final Inspection

Verify compute module is fully seated and flush.

Confirm all screws are installed and secure.

Check wire routing matches reference images and adhesive is cured.

Inspect connectors (USB, Ethernet) for obstruction or damage.

Quality Checks

No loose wires or screws

No excess adhesive near connectors

Module sits parallel to carrier board

Notes

Do not power the assembly before completing final inspection.

Any deviation from this instruction must be approved by engineering.

Nice, thanks for the photos — they’re actually pretty clear 👍
